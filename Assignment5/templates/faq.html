        A crypto wallet is a place where you can securely keep your crypto.
        There are many different types of crypto wallets, but the most popular
        ones are hosted wallets, non-custodial wallets, and hardware wallets.
        Which one is right for you depends on what you want to do with your
        crypto and what kind of safety net you want to have.
      </p>
      <h6>Hosted wallets</h6>
      <p>
        The most popular and easy-to-set-up crypto wallet is a hosted wallet.
        When you buy crypto using an app like Coinbase, your crypto is
        automatically held in a hosted wallet. It's called hosted because a
        third party keeps your crypto for you, similar to how a bank keeps your
        money in a checking or savings account. You may have heard of people
        ‚Äúlosing their keys‚Äù or ‚Äúlosing their USB wallet‚Äù but with a hosted
        wallet you don't have to worry about any of that. The main benefit of
        keeping your crypto in a hosted wallet is if you forget your password,
        you won't lose your crypto. A drawback to a hosted wallet is you can't
        access everything crypto has to offer. However, that may change as
        hosted wallets start to support more features.
      </p>
      <h6>How to set up a hosted wallet:</h6>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Choose a platform you trust. Your main considerations should be
          security, ease of use, and compliance with government and financial
          regulations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create your account. Enter your personal info and choose a secure
          password. It's also recommended to use 2-step verification (also
          called 2FA) for an extra layer of security.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Buy or transfer crypto. Most crypto platforms and exchanges allow you to
        buy crypto using a bank account or credit card. If you already own
        crypto, you can also transfer it to your new hosted wallet for safe
        keeping.
