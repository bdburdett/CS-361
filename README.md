# <CryptoTrack>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project.

- What was your motivation?
  - This was a portfolio project for CS 361 where I was able to work with a scrum team on a microservice product. I ended up connecting to CoinMarketCap's Api and am able to pull live crypto prices as well as make an account to add them in a watchlist.
- Why did you build this project? 
  - To practice using Flask since I wanted to enhance my python skills.
- What problem does it solve?
  - There is no problem per se, but I did want to make it a fluid site that was free of code smells.
- What did you learn?
  - I learned a lot about Flask and Jinja. I also learned about sockets through my teammates microservice. I was able to provide a different teammate a time API and was able to learn about ngrok where I could expose a port where he could visit the link and grab the JSON that I was passing from my local machine. I was also able to dabble with SQLAlchemy as the database.
